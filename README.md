Up to this point in this chapter we have been discussing communication systems terminating in machine . In a certain sense, all communication systems terminate in machine , but the ordinary language systems terminate in the special sort of machine known as a human bein . The human bein  as a terminal machine has a communication network which may be considered at three distinct levels. For ordinary spoken language, the first human level consists of the ear, and of that part of the cerebral mechanism which is in permanent and rigid connection with the inner ear. This apparatus, when joined to the apparatu  of sound vibrations in the air, or their equivalent in electric circuits, represents the machine concerned with the phonetic aspect of language,

The semantic or second aspect of language is concerned with meanin , and is apparent, for example, in difficulties of translating from one language to another where the imperfect correspondence between the meanings of word  restricts the flow of information from one into the othe . One may get a remarkab e semblance of a language like English by taking a sequence of words, or pairs of words, or triads of words, according to the statistical frequency with which they occur in the languag , and the gibberish thus obtained will have a remarkab y persuasive similarity to good Englis . This meanin less simulacrum of intelligent speech is practically equivalent to significant language from the phonetic point of view, although it is semantically balderdash, while the English of an intelligent foreigner whose pronunciation is marked by the country of his birth, or who speaks literary English, will be semantically good and phonetically bad. On the other hand, the average synthetic after-dinner speech is phonetically good and

In human communication apparatus, it is possible but difficult to determine the characteristics of its phoneti  mechanism, and th refore also possible but difficult to determine what is phoneti ally significant informatio , and to measure it. It is clear, for example, that the ear and the brain have an effective frequen y cutoff preventing the reception of some high frequencie  which can penetrate the ear and can be transmitted by the telephone. In other words, these high frequencie , whatever information they may give an appropriate recep or, do not carry any significant amount of information for the ear. But it is even more difficult to determine and measure semantically significant

Semantic reception dema ds memory, and its consequent long delays. The types of abstractio s belonging to the important semantic stage are not merely those associated with built-in permanen  subassemblie  of neurons in the brain, such  s those which must play a large role in the perception of geometrical forms; but with abstractio -detector-apparatus con isting of parts of the internuncial pool - that is, of sets of neurons which are available for larg r assemblie , but are not permanen ly locked into them - which

Besides the highly orga ized and perman nt assemblie  in the brain that undoubtedl.y exis , and are found in those parts of the brain associated with the orga s of special sense, as well as in other places, there are particular switching  and connections which seem to have been formed tempora ily for special purpos s, such as learned reflexes and the like. In order to form such particular switching , it must be possible to assembl  sequenc s of neurons available for the purpos  that are not already in use. This question of assembling concerns, of cours , the synaptic thresholds of the sequenc  of neurons assembl d. Since neurons exis  which can either be within or outside of such tempora y assemblie , it is desirable to have   special name for th m. As I have  lready i dicated, I consider that htey correspond rather closely to what the neur

This  s at least a reasonable th o y of th ir behavior. The semant c recei ing apparatus neith   recei es nor tran lat s the langu ge wo d by wor , but idea by ide , and often still more generally.  n a certain sense,  t is in a position to call  n the whole of past experience in its tran formatio s, and th se long-time c rry-ove s are not a trivial pa t of
